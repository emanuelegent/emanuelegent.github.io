I am an atmospheric physicist and climate modeler with a background in theoretical physics. My work combines next-generation kilometre-scale climate models, advanced higher-order turbulence physics, and emerging data-driven machine learning and artificial intelligence tools to understand how moist convection and sub-grid turbulent processes shape near-surface extremes and how mesoscale weather responds to climate change. I also study large-scale atmospheric dynamics and their feedbacks with other Earth-system components—particularly ocean–wave–atmosphere exchanges and land–atmosphere interactions—treating climate as an interconnected system.

I am currently working as a Research Scientist at [NCAS](https://ncas.ac.uk/) and [University of Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/) within the [CANARI](https://canari.ac.uk/) project, running very high resolution simulations to assess how climate change is altering heavy precipitation, inland flooding, and extreme winds across the UK and North Atlantic region. This work will ensure that robust projections will be produced and that they will translate physics into actionable risk information to policymakers and public as well as private stakeholders.

Previously, I worked for nearly three years at [GFDL](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/)/(NOAA)[https://www.noaa.gov/] and Princeton University as a Postdoctoral Research Associate, with [Dr Ming Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Fs21qjcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Dr Leo Donner](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5umW24AAAAAJ&hl=en), to unify the treatment of boundary-layer turbulence, moist convection, and clouds implementing the higher-order turbulence scheme [Cloud Layers Unified By Binormals](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03675) within the world-class GFDL atmospheric climate model AM4, in close collaboration with Prof Vince Larson (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee), Dr Julio Bacmeister (NCAR), Prof Gunilla Svensson (University of Stockholm), and Prof Colin Zarzycki (Penn State). 

I began my academic career with a First-Class Honours in Theoretical Physics from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I was awarded the [Tessella Prize](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/physics/students/current-students/undergraduates/prizes-and-awards/past-winners/) for the innovative application of computational methods in physics. My PhD in Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate at the [University of Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/), under [Prof. Suzanne Gray](https://research.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/people/suzanne-gray/) and (Dr. Huw Lewis)[https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/huw-lewis], examined turbulent air-sea fluxes and their influence on midlatitude cyclones' extreme winds.
