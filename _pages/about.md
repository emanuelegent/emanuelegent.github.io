I am an **atmospheric physicist** and **climate modeler** with a foundation in **theoretical physics**, working at the interface of **storm-resolving climate modelling**, **turbulence physics**, and **climate-risk science**. My research combines **km-scale** climate models, **large-ensemble simulations**, and **higher-order boundary-layer** turbulence representations to quantify how moist convection and sub-grid processes control near-surface **extremes** and scale up to influence large-scale circulation, including midlatitude storm tracks, under climate change. I also apply targeted **AI** and **ML** approaches**, including AI-based precipitation analysis and validation of AI weather models (e.g. GraphCast) and have expertise in running **large-eddy simulations (LES) on GPU architectures** to study turbulent processes and support scalable **uncertainty analysis**, including **regional** very high-resolution ML models. Overall, my research treats Earth’s climate as an **interconnected dynamical system**, investigating how atmospheric circulation, land–atmosphere coupling, and ocean–wave interactions shape **hazards**, **exposure-relevant extremes**, and **systemic climate risk**,

Recently, my research focus has also expanded to incorporate risk and uncertainty quantification bridging weather and climate expertise to the **insurance** and **financial** sector. I use large climate ensembles, probabilistic and tail-based diagnostics, and distribution-focused metrics to characterise event likelihood, extreme-value behaviour, and uncertainty in hazard projections, with a view toward loss-relevant modelling for wind, precipitation, and compound events. This work aims to translate physically interpretable climate signals into decision-relevant risk information for the insurance, reinsurance, and financial sectors.

I am an **atmospheric physicist** and **climate modeler** with a background in **theoretical physics**. I combine **km-scale** climate **models**, **higher-order turbulence physics**, and emerging **AI and ML** to inves tools to investigate how moist convection and sub-grid turbulent processes shape near-surface **extremes** and how mesoscale weather responds to **climate change**. I am also an active member of the [**Climate and Finance cluster**](https://research.reading.ac.uk/climate-and-finance/), contributing to efforts that bridge physical climate science, uncertainty quantification, and climate-risk assessment.

I am currently working as a Research Scientist at [NCAS](https://ncas.ac.uk/) and [University of Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/) within the [CANARI](https://canari.ac.uk/) project, running very high resolution simulations to assess how climate change is altering heavy precipitation, inland flooding, and extreme winds across the UK and North Atlantic region. 

Previously, I worked for nearly three years at [GFDL](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/)/[NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/) and Princeton University as a Postdoctoral Research Associate, with [Dr Ming Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Fs21qjcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Dr Leo Donner](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5umW24AAAAAJ&hl=en), to unify the treatment of boundary-layer turbulence, moist convection, and clouds implementing the higher-order turbulence scheme [Cloud Layers Unified By Binormals](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03675) within the world-class GFDL atmospheric climate model AM4, in close collaboration with Prof Vince Larson, Dr Julio Bacmeister, Prof Gunilla Svensson, and Prof Colin Zarzycki. 

I began my academic career with a First-Class Honours in Theoretical Physics from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I was awarded the [Tessella Prize](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/physics/students/current-students/undergraduates/prizes-and-awards/past-winners/) for the innovative application of computational methods in physics. My PhD in Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate at the [University of Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/), under [Prof. Suzanne Gray](https://research.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/people/suzanne-gray/) and [Dr. Huw Lewis](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/huw-lewis), examined turbulent air-sea fluxes and their influence on midlatitude cyclones' extreme winds.

In my leisure time, I enjoy playing volleyball and tennis, indulging in music ensembles while playing the piano, reading books, preparing delicious meals for my friends, and venturing into nature through hikes. Additionally, I love exploring new countries and their cultures.
