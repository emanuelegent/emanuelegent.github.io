I am an **atmospheric physicist and climate modeler** with a background in **theoretical physics**. I combine **kilometre-scale climate models**, **higher-order turbulence physics**, and emerging **AI and machine-learning tools** to investigate how **moist convection** and **sub-grid turbulent processes** shape **near-surface extremes** and how **mesoscale weather** responds to **climate change**. I also study **large-scale atmospheric dynamics** and their feedbacks with **ocean–wave–atmosphere exchanges** and **land–atmosphere interactions**, treating climate as an **interconnected system**. 

I am currently working as a Research Scientist at [NCAS](https://ncas.ac.uk/) and [University of Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/) within the [CANARI](https://canari.ac.uk/) project, running very high resolution simulations to assess how climate change is altering heavy precipitation, inland flooding, and extreme winds across the UK and North Atlantic region. 

Previously, I worked for nearly three years at [GFDL](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/)/[NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/) and Princeton University as a Postdoctoral Research Associate, with [Dr Ming Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Fs21qjcAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and [Dr Leo Donner](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5umW24AAAAAJ&hl=en), to unify the treatment of boundary-layer turbulence, moist convection, and clouds implementing the higher-order turbulence scheme [Cloud Layers Unified By Binormals](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03675) within the world-class GFDL atmospheric climate model AM4, in close collaboration with Prof Vince Larson, Dr Julio Bacmeister, Prof Gunilla Svensson, and Prof Colin Zarzycki. 

I began my academic career with a First-Class Honours in Theoretical Physics from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I was awarded the [Tessella Prize](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/physics/students/current-students/undergraduates/prizes-and-awards/past-winners/) for the innovative application of computational methods in physics. My PhD in Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate at the [University of Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/), under [Prof. Suzanne Gray](https://research.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/people/suzanne-gray/) and [Dr. Huw Lewis](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/huw-lewis), examined turbulent air-sea fluxes and their influence on midlatitude cyclones' extreme winds.

In my leisure time, I enjoy playing volleyball and tennis, indulging in music ensembles while playing the piano, reading books, preparing delicious meals for my friends, and venturing into nature through hikes. Additionally, I love exploring new countries and their cultures.
