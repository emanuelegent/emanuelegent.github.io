I combine <strong>kilometre-scale climate models</strong>, <strong>higher-order turbulence physics</strong>, and emerging <strong>AI and machine-learning tools</strong> to investigate how <strong>moist convection</strong> and <strong>sub-grid turbulent processes</strong> shape <strong>near-surface extremes</strong> and how <strong>mesoscale weather</strong> responds to <strong>climate change</strong>. I also study <strong>large-scale atmospheric dynamics</strong> and their feedbacks with <strong>ocean–wave–atmosphere exchanges</strong> and <strong>land–atmosphere interactions</strong>, treating climate as an <strong>interconnected system</strong>.</p> <p>I am currently working as a Research Scientist at <a href="https://ncas.ac.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NCAS</a> and <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Reading</a> within the <a href="https://canari.ac.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">CANARI</a> project, running very high resolution simulations to assess how climate change is altering heavy precipitation, inland flooding, and extreme winds across the UK and North Atlantic region.</p> <p>Previously, I worked for nearly three years at <a href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">GFDL</a>/<a href="https://www.noaa.gov/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NOAA</a> and Princeton University as a Postdoctoral Research Associate, with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=Fs21qjcAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr Ming Zhao</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5umW24AAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr Leo Donner</a>, to unify the treatment of boundary-layer turbulence, moist convection, and clouds implementing the higher-order turbulence scheme <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03675" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Cloud Layers Unified By Binormals</a> within the world-class GFDL atmospheric climate model AM4, in close collaboration with Prof Vince Larson, Dr Julio Bacmeister, Prof Gunilla Svensson, and Prof Colin Zarzycki.</p> <p>I began my academic career with a First-Class Honours in Theoretical Physics from <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Imperial College London</a>, where I was awarded the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/physics/students/current-students/undergraduates/prizes-and-awards/past-winners/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tessella Prize</a> for the innovative application of computational methods in physics. My PhD in Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate at the <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">University of Reading</a>, under <a href="https://research.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/people/suzanne-gray/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Suzanne Gray</a> and <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/huw-lewis" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Huw Lewis</a>, examined turbulent air-sea fluxes and their influence on midlatitude cyclones’ extreme winds.</p> <p>In my leisure time, I enjoy playing volleyball and tennis, indulging in music ensembles while playing the piano, reading books, preparing delicious meals for my friends, and venturing into nature through hikes. Additionally, I love exploring new countries and their cultures.</p> </body></html>
