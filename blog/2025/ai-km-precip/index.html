The diurnal cycle of precipitation, the systematic daily rhythm through which rainfall builds, peaks, and decays, emerges from a tight coupling between radiation, surface fluxes, boundary-layer growth, convection, cloud microphysics, and mesoscale organisation. Because it integrates processes across scales, the diurnal cycle has long served as a stringent test of physical realism in atmospheric models.</p> <p>Historically, even state-of-the-art weather and global climate models have struggled with this diagnostic. Rainfall over land tends to begin too early in the day, peak prematurely in the afternoon, and decay too rapidly overnight. Nocturnal precipitation, a defining feature of many continental and monsoon regions, is often weak or entirely absent. Yet these same models can perform well on bulk metrics such as monthly means or spatial correlations, creating a misleading impression of skill.</p> <p>In a recent preprint, we revisit the diurnal precipitation cycle as a <strong>process-level benchmark</strong>, using it to compare a state-of-the-art AI weather prediction system (GraphCast), a widely used reanalysis product (ERA5), satellite observations (IMERG), and a global convection-permitting simulation at 5-km resolution. The central question is simple: <em>what does the diurnal cycle reveal that headline skill scores do not?</em></p> <hr> <h3 id="models-and-datasets">Models and datasets</h3> <p>The comparison spans four distinct modelling paradigms. IMERG provides the observational reference, offering high-temporal-resolution satellite estimates of precipitation. ERA5 represents the best current synthesis of observations and model physics and serves as the training backbone for many machine-learning systems. GraphCast, a graph neural network trained on ERA5, exemplifies the new generation of data-driven weather models capable of producing skilful forecasts at unprecedented speed. Finally, a global 5-km Unified Model simulation offers a view of what changes when deep convection is largely explicitly resolved rather than parameterised.</p> <p>All datasets are analysed consistently, focusing on boreal summer (JJAS) and decomposing precipitation into its mean state, the amplitude of the diurnal harmonic, and the phase (local solar time of peak rainfall).</p> <hr> <h3 id="diagnosing-the-diurnal-cycle">Diagnosing the diurnal cycle</h3> <p>To move beyond mean fields, we decompose precipitation into its leading diurnal harmonic. Two quantities are particularly informative: the <strong>amplitude</strong>, which measures how strongly rainfall is modulated by the daily cycle, and the <strong>phase</strong>, which indicates the local time at which precipitation peaks.</p> <p>These diagnostics allow us to distinguish between models that merely reproduce the right amount of rain and those that capture the physical processes governing its evolution through the day.</p> <h3 id="a-stable-observational-reference">A stable observational reference</h3> <p>Before comparing models, it is essential to establish whether interannual variability could confound the analysis. Using IMERG observations for boreal summer 2021 and 2023, we find that the <strong>global diurnal precipitation cycle is remarkably stable</strong>.</p> <p>Mean precipitation patterns differ only modestly between the two seasons, with 2023 slightly wetter over parts of the tropical oceans. More importantly, the <strong>structure of the diurnal cycle itself — amplitude and timing — is nearly unchanged</strong>. Strong diurnal amplitudes persist over continental interiors and coastal regions, while precipitation peaks consistently occur in the late afternoon to early evening over land and during the early morning over tropical oceans.</p> <p>This stability confirms that the seasonal mismatch between datasets (IMERG and the UM 5-km simulation in 2021 versus ERA5 and GraphCast in 2023) does not compromise the intercomparison. The diurnal cycle provides a robust, physically interpretable benchmark against which different modelling approaches can be evaluated.</p> <div style="text-align: center;"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/fig_1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/fig_1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/fig_1-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/fig_1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="70%" height="auto" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">GLobal Mean precipitation characteristics and diurnal cycle during boreal summer JJA.

However, it systematically underestimates diurnal amplitude and substantially degrades the timing of precipitation, particularly over land. In several respects, GraphCast amplifies known ERA5 biases, producing a compressed diurnal cycle dominated by premature, surface-forced convection and weak nocturnal rainfall.</p> <p>In contrast, the experimental global 5-km Unified Model demonstrates clear benefits of explicitly resolving deep convection and mesoscale organisation. Improvements in diurnal amplitude and nocturnal precipitation bring the simulation closer to observations, particularly over regions dominated by organised convection. Nonetheless, persistent wet biases and early afternoon peaks highlight that even kilometre-scale models remain sensitive to boundary-layer physics, microphysics, and scale-aware convective closures.</p> <p>Overall, neither AI-based nor physics-based approaches fully resolve long-standing deficiencies in the diurnal precipitation cycle. The diurnal cycle therefore remains a <strong>crucial and physically interpretable benchmark</strong> for evaluating future weather and climate models. Progress will likely require <strong>hybrid AI–physics frameworks</strong> that combine the physical realism of kilometre-scale simulations with the computational efficiency of AI, and that explicitly target sub-daily variability during model development and training.</p> <h3 id="what-this-implies-for-ai-weather-prediction">What this implies for AI weather prediction</h3> <p>GraphCast represents a major advance in weather forecasting. Its computational efficiency and forecast skill make it operationally transformative. However, the diurnal cycle exposes a fundamental limitation of purely data-driven approaches trained on reanalysis products: they cannot outperform the physical realism of their training data at the process level.</p> <p>This is not a failure of AI, but a reflection of how learning systems work. AI models excel at reproducing patterns that are present in the data. They do not, on their own, recover physical processes that are systematically missing.</p> <hr> <h3 id="why-kilometer-scale-physics-still-matters">Why kilometer-scale physics still matters</h3> <p>The global 5-km simulation demonstrates that explicitly resolving deep convection alters not just the magnitude of precipitation, but its temporal character. Nocturnal systems emerge more naturally, amplitudes increase, and phase errors are reduced. While kilometer-scale modelling does not eliminate all biases, it provides a physically grounded reference against which both parameterised models and AI systems can be evaluated.</p> <hr> <h3 id="toward-hybrid-futures">Toward hybrid futures</h3> <p>The broader implication is not a choice between physics and AI, but their integration. Convection-permitting simulations offer a pathway to improve both parameterisations and machine-learning models, whether through training data, physically informed loss functions, or hybrid architectures that embed constraints directly into learning systems.</p> <p>The diurnal precipitation cycle should play a central role in this effort. As a diagnostic, it reveals whether models merely look right in aggregate or behave realistically in time.</p> <hr> <h3 id="final-reflections">Final reflections</h3> <p>Sub-daily precipitation is not a niche detail. It is a window into how models represent the atmosphere. By focusing on <em>when</em> rain falls, rather than only <em>how much</em>, we gain sharper insight into the strengths and limitations of both AI-based and physics-based weather prediction systems.</p> <p>📌 <strong>Preprint available here:</strong><br> The preprint is available <a href="https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.22541/essoar.176538317.73098714" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> </div> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/bioplanning_climate/">Kilometer-Scale Climate Intelligence for a Regenerative Urban Future</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2025/great-plains-clubb/">Improving Nocturnal Precipitation and Low-Level Jets over the Great Plains with an Advanced Turbulence Representation</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2024/gfdl-highlight/">Poleward Intensification of Midlatitude Extreme Winds Under Warmer Climate</a> </li> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2021/social-metwork-gentile/">Machine Learning: complement or replacement of Numerical Weather Prediction?</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Emanuele Silvio Gentile. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@5.0.0/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-htrLFfZJ6v5udOG+3kNLINIKh2gvoKqwEhHYfTTMICc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js?a0db7e5d5c70cc3252b3138b0c91dcaf" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?2781658a0a2b13ed609542042a859126"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?e0514a05c5c95ac1a93a8dfd5249b92e"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?c8a01c11a92744d44b093fc3bda915df" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.2/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js" integrity="sha256-MASABpB4tYktI2Oitl4t+78w/lyA+D7b/s9GEP0JOGI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/mathjax-setup.js?a5bb4e6a542c546dd929b24b8b236dfd"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/progress-bar.js?2f30e0e6801ea8f5036fa66e1ab0a71a" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lightbox2@2.11.5/dist/js/lightbox.min.js" integrity="sha256-A6jI5V9s1JznkWwsBaRK8kSeXLgIqQfxfnvdDOZEURY=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/photoswipe-setup.js" type="module"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/spotlight.js@0.7.8/dist/spotlight.bundle.min.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/venobox@2.1.8/dist/venobox.min.js" integrity="sha256-LsGXHsHMMmTcz3KqTaWvLv6ome+7pRiic2LPnzTfiSo=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/venobox-setup.js?897c1d9c0b6fcf82b949511c1609d055" type="text/javascript"></script> <script src="/assets/js/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js?f40d453793ff4f64e238e420181a1d17"></script> <script>
