I am thrilled to announce that I am joining [NCAS](https://ncas.ac.uk/) and the [University of Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk/meteorology/) as Research Scientist! I will use and further improve the latest state of the art climate models to run high-resolution climate simulations of how climate change is altering heavy rainfall, flooding, and extreme winds across the UK and North Atlantic.ðŸš€
