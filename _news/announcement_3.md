The preprint of our latest study, [Enhancing Great Plains Nocturnal Precipitation and Low-Level Jets in AM4 with an Extended CLUBB Closure](https://www.authorea.com/users/745948/articles/1325061-enhancing-great-plains-nocturnal-precipitation-and-low-level-jets-in-am4-with-an-extended-clubb-closure), is now online!
We show how directly prognosing the momentum flux and using a multiscale turbulent lengthscale in the higher-order closure CLUBB turbulence scheme improves precipitation timing and the representation of low-level jets in high-resolution climate simulations.
